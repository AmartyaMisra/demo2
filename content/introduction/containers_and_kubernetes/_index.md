#### Containers :

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
Container images become containers at runtime. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.

#### Kubernetes :

Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem and the services, support, and tools are widely available. Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.
