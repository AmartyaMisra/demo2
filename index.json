No one outside your account can able to access your applications without your permission. And internally we use secure mechanisms to protect your applications and their date form others.\nHow much does it cost ? Our service is free. However, applications can be ran for 2 hours only. Applications can be ran 24/7 with premium user option.\nHow many applications can I install ? For now, you can install unlimited applications with our service.\nAre my applications endpoint is public? You can choose either public. In that case, you can connect with username \u0026amp; password from anywhere in the internet. Otherwise if you want to limit the access, you can use vpn connection or limit the IP Adress from where you can connect.\nAre my data persistent ? For the free user there is no persistence, and for the premium user you can different type of persistence.\nHow can I test my applications ? It will only take some few clicks and choose the deployment name/port/variable. And it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nAre my data secured ? Yes they are safe \u0026amp; secured. we provide different security option, you can choose the security option that suits for your needs.\n"},{"uri":"https://scale-infinite.github.io/introduction/containers_and_kubernetes/managed_kubernetes_service/","title":"Managed kubernetes service","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Managed Kubernetes : Managed Kubernetes is when third-party providers take over responsibility for some or all of the work necessary for the successful set-up and operation of K8s. Depending on the vendor, ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù can refer to anything from dedicated support, to hosting with pre-configured environments, to full hosting and operation.\nKubernetes already includes an impressive set of features, including scalability, detached credential configuration, self-recovery, workload management and batch execution, and progressive application deployment, but they require significant manual configuration. Managed solutions take care of much of this configuration for you, or at least guide you through the decision-making process. Once your set-up is operational, managed solutions provide the tools necessary to automate routine processes such as updates, scaling, load-balancing and monitoring. When managed Kubernetes services include a hosting platform, they will also manage all of the maintenance and configuration needed for your infrastructure.\n"},{"uri":"https://scale-infinite.github.io/introduction/containers_and_kubernetes/cloudfloat/","title":"Cloudfloat","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Easy application deployments Cloudfloat makes it easy for everyone to deploy any kind of application within the matter of seconds.\nCloudfloat leverage all the advanced tools and technologies like containers and Kubernetes. and we take care of all the security, networking, scaling, and storage.\nBecause maintaining the infrastructure and taking care of networking, scaling is hard. we did all that hard work, and you only need to simply deploy the required application\nSecurity and Scaling Every application user installs will be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster and we use its powerful capabilities like data encryption, High Availability, Auto Scaling, and more to keep your applications secure and highly available.\nIf you are a premium member your applications will be automatically scaled based on the load.\nsimplicity Simply select the application you need to deploy from the range of pre-selected apps and fill the required detials like application name, http port TCP/UDP port, Environment variables, Whitelist ports, working directory and simply deploy the application on the platform.\nCopy and search the host name of the application to access the application.\nCloudfloat architecture "},{"uri":"https://scale-infinite.github.io/introduction/containers_and_kubernetes/","title":"containers and Kubernetes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Containers : A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.\nVirtual machines vs Containers : Kubernetes : Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem and the services, support, and tools are widely available. Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.\nA Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.\nThe worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing fault-tolerance and high availability.\nKubernetes Benefits : Extreme Scaling - Due to its decoupled architecture support, Kubernetes provide a different kind of scaling for various purposes. For scaling of servers, you can use horizontal scaling, for the containers auto and manual scaling can be used, and for pods, you can use the replication controller.\nEnhanced Deployment Speed - You can continuously update your applications without any downtime. It supports features like immutable infrastructure, self-healing, and declarative configuration.\nHigh Availability - Kubernetes is designed to handle both the application and infrastructure. With its auto replacement feature, it can replace or heal any crashed pod. It can automatically balance the network load with its in-built load balancers.\nPortability - Kubernetes supports several platforms. You can run it on any public cloud, on-premises, and even multi-cloud. Due to its high flexibility, you can use it in any environment.\nSecurity - All the confidential information, for example, passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys are stored securely on the Kubernetes secret object. You can easily replace the stored data without exposing it.\n"},{"uri":"https://scale-infinite.github.io/quick_start/create_account/","title":"Create account","tags":[],"description":"","content":"‚û°Ô∏è Go to Scaleinfinite platform.\n‚û°Ô∏è SignUP simply by using your Google account or email.\n‚û°Ô∏è Go to Create App section in the side menu.\n‚û°Ô∏è Here you can find pre-selected Images to deploy on the Go and Quickly or search here in the searchbar for the app you want.\n‚û°Ô∏è Select the respected app you require to deploy and press the Install button.\n‚û°Ô∏è Only for the first time you need to agreee the terms and condictions and verifuy with phone number.\n‚û°Ô∏è Fill the details like App name, HTTP address, TCP/UDP address.\n‚û°Ô∏è Define the ENVIRONMENT variables, whitelisted ports, and WORKING directory and click on finish.\n‚û°Ô∏è You will be redirected to this page.
