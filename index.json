A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.\nKubernetes : Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem and the services, support, and tools are widely available. Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.\n"},{"uri":"https://scale-infinite.github.io/quick_start/create_account/","title":"Create account","tags":[],"description":"","content":"‚û°Ô∏è Go to Scaleinfinite platform.\n‚û°Ô∏è SignUP simply by using your Google account or email.\n‚û°Ô∏è Go to Create App section in the side menu.\n‚û°Ô∏è Here you can find pre-selected Images to deploy on the Go and Quickly or search here in the searchbar for the app you want.\n‚û°Ô∏è Select the respected app you require to deploy and press the Install button.\n‚û°Ô∏è Fill the details like App name, HTTP address, TCP/UDP address.\n‚û°Ô∏è Define the ENVIRONMENT variables, whitelisted ports, and WORKING directory and click on finish.\n‚û°Ô∏è You will be redirected to this page.
